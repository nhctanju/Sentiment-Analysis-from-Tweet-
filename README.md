# Sentiment-Analysis-from-Tweet-
Sentiment classification from tweets using classic ML as well as Deep Learning models.
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on Sentiment Analysis of Twitter data, where tweets are classified into sentiment categories (Positive, Negative, Neutral) using both Classical Machine Learning algorithms and Deep Learning models.

The main goal of this project is to compare traditional ML approaches with advanced deep learning architectures for text classification tasks.
